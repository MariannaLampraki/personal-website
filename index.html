        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Marianna Lampraki. I am a computer science student in University of Patras, Greece. I like video games, science fiction books/movies, rock music and long walks across the beach.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning interesting things and working on my personal projects. My work is centered on front-end web development and game development (currently in the code console), but I am also interested in machine learning and data handling/analysis.</p>
        <p>In this website you can find my CV, parts of my portfolio (the full protfolio can be found in my GitHub account, see the About Me page) and other interesting things I may come accross while learning and growing. Feel free to explore.</p>

                        <p>This was part of a university project. I used the python library sci-kit learn to train a model with sample data (given by the professors), to predict the position of the requested element in a given data structure.</p>

                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                    <p>Communication is a skill I use in the Volunteer groups I am part of, in order to complete the required task in cooperation with different groups/committees. Also, I further developed my communication skills in my first job as a programming teacher and instructor for children in a summer camp.</p>

                    <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p>I have a passion for AI and machine learning. I learned the basics in the Google Seminar "Understanding Machine Learning" and put my theoretical knowledge to the test with my Learning Augmented BIS project.</p>

                    <h4>Python</h4>
                    <p>Python is my favorite programming language. It is simple and readable, which makes it easier to work on more complex problems and only having to worry about the logic and algorithms, not the language and syntax.</p>
